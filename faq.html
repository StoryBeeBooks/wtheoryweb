                            <p>Our design philosophy is rooted in the principle that "design is not just what it looks like and feels like—design is how it works." We believe that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Amateurs design for themselves</li>
                                <li>Professionals design for the user</li>
                                <li><strong>Experts design for the business goal through the user</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We use the Design Thinking Framework (Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver) to ensure every design decision is backed by research, strategy, and measurable business objectives. Our designs balance aesthetics, usability, and commercial effectiveness.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>A strategic review is an in-depth analysis of your business, conducted before any design work begins. This process includes stakeholder interviews, competitive analysis, user research, market positioning assessment, and business goals alignment. The strategic review is critical because it ensures your website isn't just beautiful—it's strategically designed to achieve specific business outcomes such as lead generation, sales growth, brand positioning, or customer retention. This approach minimizes risk, maximizes ROI, and ensures every design decision supports your overall business strategy.</p>

                            <p>We do both. We can conduct a comprehensive audit and redesign of your existing website, or build a brand-new website from scratch. For existing websites, we analyze current performance, identify friction points, conduct usability testing, and implement strategic improvements. Whether you need a complete overhaul or incremental optimization, we tailor our approach to your specific needs and budget.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes, absolutely. Every website we design is fully responsive and optimized for all devices—smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. We follow a mobile-first design approach, ensuring excellent user experiences across all screen sizes. With over 60% of web traffic coming from mobile devices, responsive design is not optional—it's essential. We also test on real devices to ensure performance and usability meet our high standards.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-question">Is accessibility important, and do you comply with WCAG and AODA?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Accessibility is a core priority for every project we undertake. We design and develop websites to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards and comply with Ontario's Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). This includes proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast, alternative text for images, and clear focus indicators. Accessible design is not only an ethical and legal requirement—it also improves SEO, expands your audience, and creates better user experiences for everyone.
