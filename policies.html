                        <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and West Solution Consulting Corp., operating under the brand name WTheory ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), a corporation incorporated under the laws of Ontario, Canada. By accessing, browsing, or using this website (wtheory.com) and any associated services (collectively, the "Website"), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy and all applicable laws and regulations.</p>

Nothing on this Website shall be construed as an offer to perform services that binds WTheory until a Client Contract is executed. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and a Client Contract, the terms of the Client Contract shall prevail.</p>

                        <p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY CEASE ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE.</p>
